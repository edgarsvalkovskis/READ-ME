### How To Become a **Full Stack** Web Developer?

## What is a growth mindset?
-  **growth mindset** believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be ***developed*** through ***perseverance*** and ***effort***; *intelligence and talent are simply good starting points*. 
- A growth mindset is **synonymous** with a **love of learning**.
- By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

### Reminders To Myself
1. Stay focused
2. The strugle will last for 9 months keep grinding
3. This or nothing

### Road to wisdom
- Eat codes
- Think about codes
- Sleep with codes
